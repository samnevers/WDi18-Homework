# TIPS
  # you can use global variables - but don't
  # instead, save the result of a method in a separate method
  # .index is the same as JS .indexof
  # store your array within a method so you can access it

# Create Each Line

def line_n
  ["Times Square", "34th", "28th", "23rd", "Union Square", "8th"]
end

def line_l
  ["8th", "6th", "Union Square", "3rd", "1st"]
end

def line_6
  ["Grand Central Terminal", "33rd", "28th", "23rd", "Union Square", "Astor Place"]
end

# Make sure we can reverse each of these lines



# Get user input & store so it is accessible
  # start line
  # start station
  # end line
  # end station

# check whether startline == endline
  # if false, uesr must transfer at Union Station
  # if true, move on to DETERMINING LINE DIRECTION

# TRANSFERRING
